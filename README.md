# Old Python Projects
Not 2017 but close enough. Please don't use these if you don't have a good understanding of python. Or at all, for that matter.
*Tested only on Windows.*

## `automod.py` - Team Fortress 2
* Finished May 13, 2019 11:45:13 PM CST

Meant to automatically download random mods from gamebanana to put in your `tf/custom` folder. Inspired by [PeterScraps' Brutal Team Fortress 2 video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAhBlu4f6B8)
### Usage
* meant to be put in your `tf/custom` folder with an additional `TF2AutoMod` folder inside of there.
* `count`, `cSkins`, `cSounds`, `cEffects` variables dictate how many effects, skins, and sounds to download.

## `corrupt.py` - Source Engine (?)
* Finished May 6, 2019 12:29:41 AM CST
* **NOTE:** This was tested only for TF2, but theoretically should work for any source game if configured right.
* FSS stands for File System Shuffler, which is the alternative name for this script.

Used for shuffling game files of the same extension within VPKs and folders.

### Usage
Before using, please adjust the `temp` variable to a temp folder of your choice.
1. Move the desired VPK or folder to be shuffled to the directory of the file. **OR** move the python script inside the directory and select `Current Directory` when prompted.
2. Run `corrupt.py` and follow the wizard.
